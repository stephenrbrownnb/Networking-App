## Description

Server side programming for a network App. Note this does not have a front end. 
## Installation 
To install locally type npm install to install the required programs.    

## Usage Instructions
To run the program type node index.js. This will launch the server which can be accessed through Insomnia as it is currently missing front end. The following routes can be used:


* `GET` all users**`/api/users`**


* `GET` a single user by its `_id` and populated thought and friend data

* `POST` a new user:

```json
// example data
{
  "username": "lernantino",
  "email": "lernantino@gmail.com"
}
```

* `PUT` to update a user by its `_id`

**BONUS**: Remove a user's associated thoughts when deleted.
